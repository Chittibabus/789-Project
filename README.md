Chicago Streetlight Outages vs Crimes
The hypothesis was to prove that " If the area is not well lit then the area is prone to more crimes". So, we studied the crimes of chicago and the streetlight outages of chicago. 

we have used data from the below links:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/milesius/chicago-crime-20012019
2. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/dataset/street_lights_out.html ----- streetlight outages data of all type of outages have been taken from this website.

code:
1. The python file "CrimeCount" is used to generate an excel file which contains the count of the crimes, this gives us three merged files of crimes and outages.
2. The r code "PoisonGLM generation" is used for generatiing Poisson GLM and generating crime rate.
